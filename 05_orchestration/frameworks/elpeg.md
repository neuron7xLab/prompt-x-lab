```
0. READ this protocol in full before producing any artifact.

1. RIC-0 (PRE-FLIGHT)
   Does any input contradict another input?
   Any field collision between declared inputs?
   Any §ASM that is logically impossible?
   If YES: log conflict, declare assumption, proceed with declared default.

2. PHASE 0
   Build inventory.json, assumptions.json.
   Create PRD.md if absent.
   Create all §PRS and §JTB stubs (even if UNVALIDATED).

3. RIC-1
   Run all 5 RIC checks against Phase 0 output.

4. PHASE 1
   Walk P0 flows as primary persona.
   Log every step with PASS/FAIL.
   Resolve all FAIL before proceeding.

5. RIC-2
   Run all 5 RIC checks against Phase 0 + Phase 1 output.

6. GATE LOOP: A → B → C → D → E → F → G → H → I
   For each gate:
   — Run process steps
   — Evaluate PASS criteria
   — Log evidence in canonical format
   — Update scorecard.json
   — On FAIL: run Blocker Protocol (§13)
   — After every 2 gates: run RIC-3

7. RIC-3 (FULL)
   Run all 5 checks against complete gate output.

8. PHASE 3: LAUNCH READINESS LOCK
   Verify all §CHK:LAUNCH items DONE.
   Verify rollback tested.
   Verify all §GAT:E metrics collecting in production.

9. RIC-FINAL
   Final integrity sweep. All 5 checks. Zero tolerance.

10. DELIVER
    PRODUCT_READINESS_DOSSIER.md — complete
    scorecard.json — all PASS
    hashes.json — all artifacts hashed
    manifests/ric_failures.json — all entries resolved
